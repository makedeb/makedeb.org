**If you see this page when navigating to the MPR or ProGet instance, read below for more information. You'll no longer be redirected to this page once the downtime has passed.**

The servers running the makedeb Package Repository, Prebuilt-MPR, and makedeb APT repositories will be experiencing downtime today from 7:00 PM CDT to 12:00 AM CDT (5 hours).

Today will involve returning home after finishing my spring semester of college, and servers are being migrated from my school back to my home as part of that process.

I would like to move things over in advance, but school WiFi speeds are proving to be too slow to transfer everything in a timely manner. To prevent the issue in the future, servers will be migrated to a VPS once I arrive.

Stay tuned to the individual websites to see once things go back online. Updates will also be posted in [makedeb's support rooms](https://docs.makedeb.org/support/obtaining-support/).
